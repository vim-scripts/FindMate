FindMate provides a convenient way (at least for me) to quickly find the
files you want. It uses the locate and file commands to achieve its goal
(vimgrep on windows). 

Originality it was released by Manuel Aguilar and Victor Guardiola but since I
couldn't reach neither of them I decide to upload it by myself (and add some
documentation) because I consider that this script could help someone else.

The original script can be still found at

You can launch FindMate by typing:

    ,, File_name (two commas)

Or

    :FindMate File_name

The shortcut can be redefined by using:

    map your_shortcut   <Plug>FindMate
